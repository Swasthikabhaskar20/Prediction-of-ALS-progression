#Algorithm : Stacking Multi-Model Regressor.
Input: 
Training Dataset TD=(A_train,B_train)
Base Regressor Models: 〖{BR〗_1,〖BR〗_2 〖,…,BR〗_n}
Meta-Model: S_f
k-folds cross-validation

Output:
Final Prediction B_test

Step:1
Initialize empty matrix M of size (x,y)for out-of-fold prediction
Step:2
Split A_train into k-folds
Step:3
For each base model 〖BR〗_i in 〖{BR〗_1,〖BR〗_2,…,〖BR〗_n}:
     For each fold (A_train_fold ,B_train_fold,A_validation_fold,B_validation_fold):
           Train M_i on (A_train_fold,B_train_fold )
            Predict B_pred on A_validation_fold
            Store B_prediction in M for the corresponding fold.
Step:4
Train Meta-Model  S_f   using M as input and B_train as target.
Step:5
Train all base modes 〖BR〗_i on full  A_train
Step:6
Predict using all base models on A_test
Step:7
Using the predictions of base models as input to S_f
Step:8
Predict final B_test using S_f
Step:9	
Return final predictions B_test
